🧠 SavvyTech Frontend Task

A React + Vite + TypeScript demo project showcasing clean architecture, modular UI components, and modern frontend development practices.
This project was built as a technical task to demonstrate proficiency in React, TypeScript, and custom UI component design — without relying on external UI frameworks.

🚀 Tech Stack

⚛️ React 19 — for building fast and modular UI

⚡ Vite 7 — for blazing-fast development and build

🌀 Tailwind CSS 4 — for styling and responsive layouts

🎨 Custom Components — built manually (no UI libraries like ShadCN/UI or MUI)

🧩 TypeScript — for type safety and maintainability

📦 Context API — for lightweight state management

🪶 React Icons — for clean and consistent icons

🪄 clsx + tailwind-merge — for elegant class composition

🆔 uuid — for unique key generation

🧩 Key Design Decisions
1. 💅 Custom UI Components

All UI components such as buttons, inputs, and modals were implemented manually — to demonstrate control over styling, accessibility, and UX.

In production, UI frameworks (e.g., ShadCN/UI, MUI, Radix, etc.) are preferred for speed, consistency, and scalability.

2. 🧠 Simple & Scalable State Management

Used React Context API instead of external state managers (like Zustand, Redux) — since this is a demo project and doesn’t require complex state handling.

This keeps the implementation lightweight yet expressive enough to show understanding of state organization patterns.

3. 🧭 Clean Project Structure

Components are reusable and isolated

Hooks manage logic and side effects

Contexts handle shared state

TypeScript types ensure clear data contracts
